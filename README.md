## Managing time
### Problem
Time management, argueably one of the hardest things to properly organize and manage, I struggle with managing my time lots at home so I decided that I needed a change in lifestylem, resulting in the creation of timer pro v2, the next generation epic timer that helps me and possibly you too organize your time more efficiently!

### Solution
Using python, this code helps you set a timer to help manage your future event/screen times, allowing you to select the amount of seconds to limit your screen time and count down timer to remind you when to go!

### Setup
Install required packages using 'pip install requirements.txt'
